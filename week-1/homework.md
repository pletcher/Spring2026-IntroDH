## Bring to Class

Write a 1- to 2-page response to the readings. There is no
explicit prompt, but your response should formulate an argument and have a
thesis statement that pertains to the readings. You might argue with or against
them — the important thing is to use this response as a space to think.

_Nota bene_: You _may_ use generative AI for this assignment, but you should
not use it to write for you. You might use ChatGPT or Claude, for example, to
formulate ideas or to discuss your argument and/or thesis statement.

You are not _expected_ to use AI.

If you choose to use AI, you _must_ cite it in accordance with the statement in
the syllabus, and you must provide a printout of everything generated by the
model that pertains to this assignment. Failure to do so will result in an
automatic failure of this assignment.

Remember, these models make mistakes. It probably won't be able to cite the
readings accurately, for example. Use them as tools, not as replacements for
your own thinking.
