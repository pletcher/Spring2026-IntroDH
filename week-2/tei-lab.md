# TEI Lab

In this lab, you will produce a digital edition of the text that you chose from
Special Collections.

Be sure to photograph a few pages — it's okay if you don't have time to
transcribe them all.

Write a short (2–3-page) reflection on the process of transcribing to TEI. Some
questions to get you started:

- What is the name of your text? Who is the author? What are some of its
  important features?
- In what ways is TEI helpful? Did you find that it got in the way?
- What editorial decisions need to be made when transcribing a print edition
  versus a manuscript?
- Could/should/would you transcribe both manuscript and print edition in the
  same TEI document? Why or why not?

Use the TEI Guidelines and examples to help!
