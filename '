# Web Scraping Lab

## Statement on Gen AI

**Again, do not use generative AI for this assignment.**

Using generative AI for this lab will be considered an academic
integrity violation, which I am required to report.

## Network work: scraping Wikipedia

For this lab, you will use what you've learned about Python so far
to collect data from Wikipedia. Your task is to build a network of
pages, beginning from a page of your choosing.

Networks are composed of nodes (or vertices) and edges. Each
node should contain information about a single Wikipedia page,
and the node's edges are the links that it contains to other
Wikipedia pages.

Using the [Digital Humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities)
page as an example, your network might look something like the following:

```json
{
  "title": "Digital Humanities",
  "content": "...",
  "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_humanities",
  "links": [
    {
      "title": "Computing",
      "content": "...",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing",
      "links": [
        {
          "title": "..."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Information technology",
      "content": "...",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology",
      "links": [{}]
    }
  ]
}
```

Notice how each node has the basic form

```json
{
  "title": "The page title",
  "content": "The text content of the page",
  "url": "The URL for the page",
  "links": "The top n links to other Wikipedia pages."
}
```

The goal here is for you to explore Python. If you have time and would like an extra challenge, you could
attempt to identify loops in your network: links that refer back to pages you have already indexed.

You'll need to keep track of how deep your network gets — you don't need to go more than four or five levels down.

We will return to the content that you have scraped for the NLP Lab, so try to choose a topic that
you find interesting.

For your submission, please turn in the script that you used to gather your network, as well
as a JSON dump of the data itself.

Please also submit a short (2-3–page) lab report, detailing your hypothesis/es about
the network that you're exploring, your methods, and a brief discussion of the tools
and techniques that you used to complete the lab.

This lab is due at 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, October 28, 2025.
