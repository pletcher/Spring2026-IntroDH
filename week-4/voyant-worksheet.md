# Voyant Worksheet

As you assemble a corpus, please work through the following questions.

1. What is the guiding principle behind your corpus? Are you going the
   single-author route, or is there another element of connective tissue
   that you would like to explore?
2. What are the most frequent words in your corpus?
3. Are you surprised by any of the statistics? Do you notice any mistakes?
4. What patterns do the Voyant tools help you identify?
5. Create a visualization (distinct from those provided by Voyant) in
   [Palladio](https://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio-app). How did you choose
   this visualization, and why is it a good fit for your data?
