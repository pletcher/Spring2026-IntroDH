# Voyant Lab

For this lab, you will explore the novels of Jane Austen (1775–1817) using Voyant.
The goal is not to uncover anything particularly new—that would be great,
but it's not expected!—but rather to see what distant reading can show
us about Jane Austen's writing.

The precise topic(s) for exploration are up to you. You might look into word
frequencies and speaker gender, for example; or you might explore how certain
topics ebb and flow over the course of each novel. You might also want to
consider how Austen's style develops over time.

Your submission will take the form of a short (about 1000-word) paper, describing

1. The process and criteria that you used to assemble a corpus;
2. The tools in Voyant that you used to analyze the corpus, and why;
3. A critical discussion of what your data reveals about Austen's novels.

Note that, although the emphasis here is on distant reading, you might have to
read a bit of these novels!

You should include no fewer than three figures from your analysis in Voyant—be
sure to add descriptive captions and to explain their relevance to your
overarching research question.
